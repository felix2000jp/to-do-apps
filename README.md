# To Do Apps
Basicaly I built the same web app 3 times with different tools. This is just to compare how easy (and fun) it is to build a simple ToDo application with django, flask and express.

## The App
Because this is something that will be done with 3 different tools, i wanted to make something as simple as possible, and for that purpose there is no better app than a To Do List. There is a reason why most online tutorials use it as first project example, it has create, read, update and delete (CRUD) functionalities,and at the same time it implements them in a very straightforward way. A To Do List would allow me to get a taste of the basic workflow of each one of these frameworks rather quickly.

The To Do List is just a single page that shows a table with all the tasks you have created and their status. You can change the status of any task from finished (True) to not finished (False) and vice versa (note that this is the only thing you can update about a task, you cannot change it's name). You can also delete any task. Creating a task requires only you give it a name since it's status defaults to False (not finished).

Because the goal here is to compare only django, flask and express, no front-end frameworks (like react) were used, jinja2 was used with django and flask and nunjucks (because it's very similar to jinja2) with express. I also used bootstrap 5.2 because it makes the page presentable very easily and fast.

## Django
I have used django a lot lately, mostly because I wanted to learn it, so this was very fast to put together. The thing I like the most about django are class-based-views, this just make it very easy to put things together. If the app were to just show the tasks in the database, that could be achieved using only two lines of code (plus imports, and urls, and apps, etc) with class-based-views. It's comunity is also a very big plus, if there is an error you find, chances are someone has solved it already. It is not very relavant here, but jinja2 is also a big advantage. The thing about jinja2 is that not everyone wants to learn front-end frameworks, some of us just want to play around with the server side and show something that looks half good in the front-end (thanks bootstrap). Because jinja2 is used in django, and django has a huge comunity, there is a lot o tutorials online that show you the ropes with jinja2, which is a lot more than what you get with view engines like nunjucks.

The biggest negative I found with django is that it can be too much. Because it's batteries-included it has a lot of features, some of which you don't need, and that makes the learning curve steeper. Another negative (and somewhat more personal) is about class-based-views. Yes I am aware that I said that this is a positive, and it is, however it can make things a lot more complicated than it needs to be. I like to make things as clean as possible, and cbvs are the cleanest way in django, but not always. This means that I always looked for the cbv way of making things even when the function based way is the best way. This is expecially a problem when you want more than one funcionality in one page, it is not too hard if you want to list and create tasks in one page (just use a ListView and override the post method), but what about creating, deleting, reading and creating in just one page, all of this with just one view? Beware that this is a noob's view on the subject, I am in no way a master of django (not even close).
