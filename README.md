# To Do Apps
Basicaly I built the same web app 3 times with different tools. This is just to compare how easy (and fun) it is to build a simple ToDo application with django, flask and express.

## The App
Because this is something that will be done with 3 different tools, i wanted to make something as simple as possible, and for that purpose there is no better app than a To Do List. There is a reason why most online tutorials use it as first project example, it has create, read, update and delete (CRUD) functionalities,and at the same time it implements them in a very straightforward way. A To Do List would allow me to get a taste of the basic workflow of each one of these frameworks rather quickly.

The To Do List is just a single page that shows a table with all the tasks you have created and their status. You can change the status of any task from finished (True) to not finished (False) and vice versa (note that this is the only thing you can update about a task, you cannot change it's name). You can also delete any task. Creating a task requires only you give it a name since it's status defaults to False (not finished).

Because the goal here is to compare only django, flask and express, no front-end frameworks (like react) were used, jinja2 was used with django and flask and ejs with express. I also used bootstrap 5.2 because it makes the page presentable very easily and fast.

## Django
I have used django a lot lately, mostly because I wanted to learn it, so this was very fast to put together. The thing I like the most about django are class-based-views, this just make it very easy to put things together. If the app were to just show the tasks in the database, that could be achieved using only two lines of code (plus imports, and urls, and apps, etc) with class-based-views. It's comunity is also a very big plus, if there is an error you find, chances are someone has solved it already. It is not very relavant here, but the templating language is also a big advantage. The thing about this is that not everyone wants to learn front-end frameworks, some of us just want to play around with the server side and show something that looks half good in the front-end (thanks bootstrap). Because django has a built-in templating language and a huge comunity, there is a lot o tutorials online that show you the ropes (jinja2 is really close so learning one is like learning the other), which is a lot more than what you get with view engines like ejs.

The biggest negative I found with django is that it can be too much. Because it's batteries-included it has a lot of features, some of which you don't need, and that makes the learning curve steeper. Another negative (and somewhat more personal) is about class-based-views. Yes I am aware that I said that this is a positive, and it is, however it can make things a lot more complicated than it needs to be. I like to make things as clean as possible, and cbvs are the cleanest way in django, but not always. This means that I always looked for the cbv way of making things even when the function based way is the best way. This is expecially a problem when you want more than one funcionality in one page, it is not too hard if you want to list and create tasks in one page (just use a ListView and override the post method), but what about creating, deleting, reading and creating in just one page, all of this with just one view? Beware that this is a noob's view on the subject, I am in no way a master of django (not even close). 

## Flask
The next framework i chose was flask. Flask is very simple when compared to django, and that makes it very easy to learn, expecially if you already know django. If i had to describe flask i would say it is express but in python.

This was my very first time using flask, and prior to this i knew nothing about it besides the fact it is has a minimalit aproach to web dev. This is something a like, I like to make sure that I know exactly what is going on behind the scenes and the best way to make sure that happens is to use a tool that gives you very few features out of the box. Another thing that crossed my mind while using flask is how this framework is exceptional at showing you what is going on the backend (since you are coding it from the ground up) and how it probably be better to learn this before learning django (it would definetly make the learning curve less steep).

Since I already knew django, flask was very easy to use but not as fun. This was surprising to me since i tend to prefer microframeworks. I can't really put my finger on it but it just did not feel as satisfying as django or express. The main anoyance I found was with database integration. I am a total newbie when it comes to flask, but I found the database integration to be ver clunky, having to create it from the terminal is weird and i haven't quite figured out how to do migrations smoothly. That and the fact that for some reason my text editor was not autocompleting made this process quite anoying. Bare in mind that my criticisms come from my very limited personal experience so it is totally possible that there is another, cleaner, way to uses databases, and my autocomplete could be just a one time bug.

To me the thing with flask is that it has a very simple aproach to web dev, making it a very good first choice if you want to program in python. If you start with it I think it will be easier to learn django, and if you start with django it's like you almost know flask (or perhaps I just think so because it is also very similar to express and I alrefy know how to use it).
