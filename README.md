# To Do Apps
Basicaly I built the same web app 3 times with different tools. This is just to compare how easy (and fun) it is to build a simple ToDo application with django, flask and express.

## The App
The I build is just a single page that shows a table with a set of tasks, a task is just a name (string) and a status (bool), that can be deleted or edited. Note that the only thing about the task that can be updated is it's status.
